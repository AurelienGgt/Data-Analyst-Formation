# Data-Analyst-Formation


Link to the training: https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/324-data-analyst


In this training, I had to complete a series of 10 projects, but for GitHub, I decided to only upload the 5 Python projects.

--------------------------------------------------------
Project 1: Conduct a Public Health Study:
--------------------------------------------------------

Get started with Python by analyzing FAO data on world hunger.

For this project, you'll need to do some basic cleaning, followed by calculations using Numpy, and then create some graphs with Matplotlib and Seaborn.


--------------------------------------------------------
Project 2: Optimize the Data Management of a Shop:
--------------------------------------------------------


The data from this business is poorly organized. Integrate different datasets to perform the required analysis.

For this project, you'll need to clean the data by removing potential duplicates and perform some calculations with Numpy.


--------------------------------------------------------
Project 3: Analyze the Sales of a Bookstore:
--------------------------------------------------------


You have access to all sales data from your client, a bookstore. Respond to their requests by analyzing purchasing behaviors.

For this project, you'll need to do more thorough data cleaning to ensure that the analysis is meaningful and visualized effectively.


--------------------------------------------------------
Project 4: Conduct a Market Study:
--------------------------------------------------------


Study the market for your company using clustering and PCA to make strategic recommendations.

For this project, you'll need to clean the data thoroughly and begin creating unsupervised clustering algorithms.


--------------------------------------------------------
Project 5: Detect Counterfeit Bills:
--------------------------------------------------------


Build a predictive model to detect counterfeit bills using clustering and logistic regression with Python.

For this project, cleaning isn’t really necessary since we already have a clean dataset. However, you will need to perform imputation for missing values and create a detection script for the bills at the end of the project.

I’m going to upload my projects from the formation.
