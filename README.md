The Data Analyst Formation at OpenClassrooms is a comprehensive program designed to equip you with the essential skills in data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Throughout the training, you'll work on real-world projects that simulate business challenges and help you extract actionable insights from data. Although the full program includes 10 projects, I've chosen to showcase the 5 Python-based projects on GitHub. 🚀
