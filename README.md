## Data-Analyst-Formation

[**Link to the training**](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/paths/324-data-analyst)

In this training, I had to complete a series of **10 projects**, but for GitHub, I decided to only upload the **5 Python projects**.

---

### Project 1: Conduct a Public Health Study :

- **Description**:  
  Get started with Python by analyzing FAO data on world hunger.  
  For this project, you'll perform basic data cleaning, execute calculations with Numpy, and create graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Project 2: Optimize the Data Management of a Shop :

- **Description**:  
  The business data is poorly organized. In this project, you'll integrate different datasets to conduct the required analysis.  
  The focus is on cleaning the data by removing duplicates and performing calculations using Numpy.

### Project 3: Analyze the Sales of a Bookstore :

- **Description**:  
  Analyze purchasing behaviors by exploring the complete sales data of a bookstore client.  
  This project requires thorough data cleaning to ensure the analysis is meaningful and the insights are effectively visualized.

### Project 4: Conduct a Market Study :

- **Description**:  
  Study the market for your company using clustering techniques and PCA to provide strategic recommendations.  
  This project involves extensive data cleaning and the development of unsupervised clustering algorithms.

---

### Project 5: Detect Counterfeit Bills :

- **Description**:  
  Build a predictive model to detect counterfeit bills using clustering and logistic regression in Python.  
  Although the dataset is already clean, you will need to perform imputation for missing values and create a detection script at the end of the project.
