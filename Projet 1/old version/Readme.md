Project 1: Conduct a Public Health Study
----------------------------------------

Take control of the Python language to analyze FAO data on global hunger.

To understand the ins and outs of this training and the Data Analyst profession, we learned:

- Various numpy operations for scientific calculations to obtain global percentages.
- The use of Pandas for data visualization and file handling.
- The use of matplotlib and seaborn to get more relevant visualizations of our data through graphs.
- Through this project, I was able to master some of the most important functions in Python, while working with a dataset that had relatively few errors, which was interesting to start with since cleaning more complex data could have been tricky.

Finally, since the data is official, this gives us a very interesting real-world case to work with.
