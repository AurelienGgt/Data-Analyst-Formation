Project 2: Optimize the Data Management of a Store
------------------
The data of this company is poorly organized. Integrate the different datasets to perform the required analysis.

For this second project, we worked with the data of a company that sold wine.

For this project, we learned how to:

- Detect, understand, and visualize outliers
- Clean data
- Remove duplicates using functions like drop_duplicates()
- Compare the cheapest products with the most expensive ones using min() and max()
  
This allowed us to better understand data cleaning, and thus be more capable of verifying our data afterward. However, the dataset was relatively small, so the cleaning process remained quite basic.
