Project 4: Conduct a Market Study
-------------


Study your companyâ€™s market using clustering and PCA to make strategic recommendations.

For this project, you will need to:

- Perform simple clustering such as PCA, which can help visualize:
- A scree plot of eigenvalues
- A correlation circle
- A scatter plot
- Perform exploratory data analysis:
- Use a hierarchical clustering (dendrogram for visualization)
- Use k-means clustering and visualize it via the elbow method
- Visualize a heatmap


With this, we obtain a meaningful analysis of our project.
